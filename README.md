A little project for my Semester 2 Assignment. Inspired from [chillyistkult (Benjamin Schuch)](https://github.com/chillyistkult) project.

The GUI version doesn't required master branch to work.

Run and Tested in :- 
1. Apache NetBeans IDE 12.5
2. Visual Studio Code

There are still some mess in this code but I already finish this. If anyone wanted to pull request you are freely to do so.
